Tracker Guidelines,,Editor Comments,,Misc. Notes,,,,
"Remember to use the right formatting (whether that be to credit the sample, non-italic album names, putting quotes over songs, bolding the numbers in ""Tracklists"" or anything else.) If you feel like something is missing or you did something wrong, copy something a previous submission has already done and use that as the guideline or ask.",,https://pillowcase.su is the best website for holding files,,"The universal tracker timezone is ""EST"". If something leaks, make sure to look at the EST timezone, for example something could've leaked on April 24th in another timezone but it was April 23rd EST.",,,,
"No fan remakes, no unofficial mixtapes, nothing that's commercially available, always upload to a site that can be streamed off of.",,"cobalt.tools is really good for downloading any type of video (YouTube, TikTok, Vimeo etc.)",,"All dates are to be written in ""Month Day, Year"" format as opposed to the ""Month/Day/Year or Day/Month/Year"" format",,,,
"Make sure you use alternating colors and check often that they are not broken (Format, Alternating Colors, choose white and the grey that has one grey in between it and white.)",,,,Please don't use the restore function if there's new info unless its extremely necessary.,,,,
"No released remixes, no matter how obscure, should be on this page. Those should be in Misc / Released Tracker.",,,,"Do NOT use Discord for links, Discord made it so after 24 hours the link expires and you have to re-paste it into discord to get a new link. Just use another service to host the link instead of Discord.",,,,
"All music video editions, live freestyles, and released remixes go in Misc / Released Tracker.",,,,"If a ""???"" song gets its name revealed, make sure to also sort it alphabetically and do NOT leave it with the other ""???"" songs after the name has been added.",,,,
,,,,"""Rumored Not Avaliable"" always have N/A if they don't have a link, ""Conficting Sources Not Avaliable"" and Confirmed Not Avaliable"" do not.",,,,
,,,,"If an OG File of a beat leaks, ""Beat Only"" should be selected and not ""OG File"". ""Beat Only"" is more important because (while it is an OG File) knowing that only the beat is avaliable with no vocals is more important than knowing it's an OG file, in ""Stems"" however of course it's OG File.",,,,
,,,,"Try to refrain from saying stuff like ""Cut-down version of V1"" and ""Same as the version above but ____"" as if a new leak submission is put inbetween those notes, they become unclear.",,,,
